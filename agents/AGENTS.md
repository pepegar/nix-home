# Personal Agent Rules

## Do never git commit without the approval of the user

## Do never git push without the approval of the user

## Track Progress with Tasks
Always create tasks (todo list) when working on something to track progress.

## PRs Have No Description
When creating PRs, leave the description empty.

## External Actions Require Approval
Never post comments, create issues, or perform any write action on external services
(GitHub, Jira, Slack, etc.) without explicitly asking for my approval first.
Always show me the exact content you plan to post and wait for confirmation.
